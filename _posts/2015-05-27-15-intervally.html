description: "My first experiment with SVG. The lines are mapped to frequencies that represents all 12 notes between Middle C and the 5th C on the Piano. You can drag the blob to hear all of the frequencies. Right now it only supports Chrome. My friend Chris and I are going to build out more features on top of it, like an interval trainer (guess the interval) as well as a sandbox that lets you add blobs, change frequencies, as well as drag the blobs from left to right to adjust things like timbre. I was responsible for the MVP of the product. You can checkout the code at github.com/realalexhomer/intervally."
