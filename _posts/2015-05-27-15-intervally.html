description: "My first experiment with SVG. The lines are mapped to frequencies that represents all 12 notes between Middle C and the 5th C on the Piano. You can drag the blob to hear all of the frequencies. Right now it only supports Chrome (working with svg is fun!). You can checkout the code at github.com/realalexhomer/intervally."
