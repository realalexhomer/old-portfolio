		<p>I am a good writer. I've spent lots of time learning to write. In college my favorite professor told me I shouldnâ€™t become anything except a writer.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="cd-service cd-service-2">
		<p>My trajectory of becoming a writer changed <span id="days"></span> days, <span id="hours"></span> hours, <span id="minutes"></span> minutes, and <span id="seconds"></span> seconds ago, when I wrote my first line of code. At this time I was working at a startup called <a id ="rheti" href="http://www.rheti.com/learn-more">Rheti.</a></p>

		<p>At first coding was something I did just for work but I fell in love. I believe this is because coding is similar to writing. I like to think that coding is easier for me now that I've made this connection, even though it is still really hard.</p>

		<p>To get better at programming I enrolled in Dev Bootcamp. DBC is an amazing example of alternative education. Shereef Bishay once said that DBC turned me into a world-class beginner.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="cd-service cd-service-5">
		<p>During DBC two friends and I created a web app called <a href="https://cmdvninja.herokuapp.com">Command V Ninja</a>. When we were finished I realized I finally "know" how to program.</p><br>
		<p> I also began working on some other <a href="/projects">projects</a> you might find interesting.</p>
